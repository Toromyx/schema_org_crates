/// An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing at the most general/abstract level, a work of film or television.
///
/// For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" has a titleEIDR of  "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J". This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls "edits". See [[editEIDR]].
///
/// Since schema.org types like [[Movie]], [[TVEpisode]], [[TVSeason]], and [[TVSeries]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.
