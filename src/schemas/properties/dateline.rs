/// A [dateline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline) is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.
///
/// Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using [[locationCreated]] (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use [[contentLocation]].
///
/// Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
