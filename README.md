# Schema.org Schemas as Rust Types

> [Schema.org](https://schema.org) is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.

This crate implements these schemas as Rust types.

## Usage

If you actually want to use this library, be aware that there might need to be a big rework: <https://github.com/Toromyx/schema_org_types_rs/issues/15>.

Please also tell me how you want to use Schema.org types in Rust.
