/// An [EIDR](https://eidr.org/) (Entertainment Identifier Registry) [[identifier]] representing a specific edit / edition for a work of film or television.
///
/// For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" whose [[titleEIDR]] is "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J" has several edits, e.g. "10.5240/1F2A-E1C5-680A-14C6-E76B-I" and "10.5240/8A35-3BEE-6497-5D12-9E4F-3".
///
/// Since schema.org types like [[Movie]] and [[TVEpisode]] can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use [[titleEIDR]] alone (for a general description), or alongside [[editEIDR]] for a more edit-specific description.
