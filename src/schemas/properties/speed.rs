/// The speed range of the vehicle. If the vehicle is powered by an engine, the upper limit of the speed range (indicated by [[maxValue]]) should be the maximum speed achievable under regular conditions.\n\nTypical unit code(s): KMH for km/h, HM for mile per hour (0.447 04 m/s), KNT for knot\n\n*Note 1: Use [[minValue]] and [[maxValue]] to indicate the range. Typically, the minimal value is zero.\n* Note 2: There are many different ways of measuring the speed range. You can link to information about how the given value has been determined using the [[valueReference]] property.
